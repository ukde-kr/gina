# Mini LangChain Project 

Plans!
-----
- 🦜🔗 Get a basic understanding of [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) so I can talk like a pro.
- 📚 complete [this Udemy course](https://digitalhypercomp.udemy.com/course/langchain/learn/lecture/38288884#content)
- 📝 Summarize what my learnings in a blog.
- 💡 build a simple 'ice breaker' tool to help people share fun facts about themselves!
